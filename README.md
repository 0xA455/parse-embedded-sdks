#Parse Embedded C SDKs

[Parse Embedded C SDKs](https://www.parse.com/products/iot) provide support for Arduino Yún, Raspberry Pi, and TI CC3200.

##Arduino Yún

Please see README in the [yun directory](yun/).

##Raspberry Pi / Ubuntu / Debian / other Unix-based systems

Please see our [Raspberry Pi Quickstart](https://www.parse.com/apps/quickstart#embedded/raspberrypi).


##TI CC3200

Please see README in the [cc3200 directory](cc3200/).

##Sample App

We prepared a [sample app](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Anydevice) that demonstrates how to provision IoT devices using a companion phone app such that the IoT devices can securely access user-specific data on the Parse Cloud.  This sample app also demonstrates how to send push notifications between the phone app and IoT devices.
